# RoadRage
a game where you have to maneuver a car within the screen region, dodging incoming dropped boxes from big rigs ahead on the road. As you progress the game will slowly increase in difficulty (more frequent boxes in more complex patterns) and your score will be increasing as your time survived increases and number of boxes dodged increase. The player will have bounding collisions with the screen and collisions with the boxes. The player and truck will move from lane to lane on the road with each move left / move right button press, so there will be a set number of possible x positions for either. The car can move forward or backward as well and that will be less restricted. The truck will have a fixed position besides from moving side to side dropping the boxes which will move towards the player until they go past and off screen. The camera for our game will be set above and behind the player car and give a top down view.
